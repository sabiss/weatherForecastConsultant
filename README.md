<h1><strong>Weather Forecast Consultant</strong><h1>
<p>in this project I made a page where it is possible to consult the weather forecast of the week of a city chosen by the user. The site will save the last 3 queries made by the user and will show images of these respective cities. This project is a technical challenge proposed by the monitors of the ProEdu project<p>

<h2>Technologies used<h2>
<p>this project relies on HTML5 and CSS3 tools and the JavaScript programming language. The meteorological query was made using <strong><a href = "https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap</a></strong> API Data. The images of the cities searched were taken from the <a href = "https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html"><strong>Flickr</strong></a> Photo Search API<p>
