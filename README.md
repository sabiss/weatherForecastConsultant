<h1>weather Forecast Consultant<h1>
<p>in this project I made a page where it is possible to consult the weather forecast of the week of a city chosen by the user. The site will save the last 3 queries made by the user and will show images of these respective cities. This project is a technical challenge proposed by the monitors of the ProEdu project<p>
